## Ulyp: Recording Java code execution for faster debugging

[Ulyp](https://github.com/cheburitos/ulyp) is a recording debugger and a reverse engineering tool for JVM apps. 
The blogpost shows how the tool can help investigating internals of Hibernate framework.

### Introduction

The article presents [Ulyp](https://github.com/cheburitos/ulyp) which is an open-source instrumentation agent that records method calls 
(including argument and return values) of all third-party libraries of JVM apps. Software engineer 
can later upload a recording file to the UI desktop app in order to better understand the 
internals of libraries and even the whole applications. The tool can help developers understand
the internals of frameworks faster, gain deeper insights, find inefficiencies in software, as 
well as debug more effectively.

In a few words, Ulyp converts this:

```java
DatabaseJDBCSource source = new DatabaseJDBCSource();

LoadingCache<Integer, DatabaseEntity> cache = Caffeine.newBuilder()
        .maximumSize(10_000)
        .expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
        .refreshAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(1))
        .build(source::findById);

DatabaseEntity fromCache = cache.get(5);
```

to this:

### Challenges in Modern Software engineering

The software engineering field nowadays is completely different from what it was 10 years ago. 
As scale of IT solutions rises, the complexity of systems is now is on entirely different level. 
A typical application may have thousands of instances in multiple availability zones. At the 
same time, the amount of code is usually around hundreds thousands lines.

The number of frameworks and libraries used as a dependency in a typical app is also higher than it was before. 
When it comes to gigantic frameworks which require tons of boilerplate, Java language is somewhat notorious. 
The ecosystem carries the largest frameworks ever created. Some examples are Spring, Hibernate and others.

One of the problem a modern Java developer faces is understanding code quickly. An average engineer spends 
way more time reading code than writing it. Understanding how libraries and frameworks work under the hood 
and what they do is extremely vital for proper software development.

Another problem is debugging a running instance of an application on some environment where classic 
debugger might not be available. Usually, it’s possible to use logs and APM tracers, but these tools 
might not always suffice the needs.

One possible way to mitigate some of these problems is code execution recording for later analysis. 
The idea is by far not new as there are already dozens of time-travel debuggers for different languages.

### Introducing Ulyp: A recording debugger for Java/Kotlin

Ulyp is an instrumentation agent written specifically for this task. Recording all function calls along 
with return values and arguments is possible thanks to JVM bytecode instrumentation. This effectively 
eliminates the need of breakpoints in certain cases. It’s also feasible to record the execution flow 
in several apps at the same time via remote control. A developer is able to record and observe what 
happened in a distributed environment.

All data is dumped to the file a user specified via system properties. There are auxiliary threads which 
do the job of converting objects to binary format and writing to file. The resulting file can later be 
opened in UI app and entire flow can be analyzed.

Currently, Ulyp uses bytebuddy library which does an immense job of handling all the work of instrumentation 
and makes it extremely easy for all Java developers. The rest is relatively straightforward to implement. 
The ongoing blogposts will shed a light on how the tool is implemented. Right now, let’s move to action.

### Case Study: Hibernate internals

Let’s start with on of the well known Java frameworks — Hibernate. We are going to use Spring to setup the 
demo and use Hiberante with H2 embedded data source. We will write very simple code snippet which takes a 
newly created entity and persists it to the database. We then observe the execution flow by recording it 
using Ulyp.

The demo is quite straightforward. Our entity is as follows:

```java
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    @Basic
    private String firstName;
    @Basic
    private String lastName;
    @Basic
    private String phoneNumber;
    @Basic
    private int age;
}
```

We also have a JPA repository to save entities.

```java
@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository<Person, Long> {

}
```

There is also a service which is marked with transactional annotation, so that it opens a transaction
whenever any of its’ public method is called.

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class PersonStoreService {

    @Autowired
    private PersonRepository repository;

    public void save(Person person) {
        repository.save(person);
    }

    public Person find(long id) {
        return repository.findOne(id);
    }
}
```

Now, we have main method which looks like this:

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Configuration.class);
        PersonStoreService store = context.getBean(PersonStoreService.class);

        Person person = new Person();
        person.setFirstName("John");
        person.setLastName("Doe");
        person.setAge(42);

        store.save(person);
        System.out.println("Stored: " + person);

        Person foundPerson = store.find(person.getId());
        System.out.println("Found: " + foundPerson);
    }
```

The whole code is available at the [repo](https://github.com/cheburitos/ulyp-examples/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/hibernate/HibernateDemo.java). 
After we execute the code, it will print the result:

```
Stored: org.example.hibernate.util.Person@52d14571
Found: org.example.hibernate.util.Person@75268ef2
```

We’d like to understand what exactly happened when we call the code. Let’s start using Ulyp. 
The only thing we need to do is to specify system properties, nothing else is changed.

```
-javaagent:/home/user/ulyp-agent-1.0.0.jar
-Dulyp.file=/tmp/test-spring.dat
-Dulyp.methods=**.PersonStoreService.*
-Dulyp.record-constructors
-Dulyp.record-collections=JDK
-Dulyp.record-arrays
```

The first property tells the JVM that the agent should be used. The second property `ulyp.file` specifies file 
path where ulyp should store all recorded data. The next property tells Ulyp when it should start recording. 
In this case, whenever any method of class named `PersonStoreService` is called, 
ulyp will start recording all nested calls. `ulyp.record-constructors` tells to instrument and record constructors, 
and `ulyp.record-collections=JDK` allows to partially record collection values, but only for JDK standard library collections. 
The collections itself are not instrumented, i.e. Ulyp do not record calls like `ArrayList.add`, but can record some 
items from ArrayList if it is passed as an argument (or returned from) to some recorded method call.

After running the demo with properties set, we can upload the file to UI desktop app.
The first thing we see is the list of recorded methods on the left.

![hibernate](https://cheburitos.github.io/assets/2024/10-13/hibernate1.png)

Every entry in the list is a recorded method of some instance of `PersonStoreService` class. 
We can also see the duration of methods, as well as the number of recorded calls inside. 
There are 90,000 calls for just storing an entity with `Spring`, `Hibernate` and `H2` inside. 
But keep in mind, there is a lot of bootrstrapping is done once the method is called for the first time. 
Next call would probably have less methods recorded. Duration is also quite high for storing just a 
single entity. There is an explanation to this — not only there was not enough time for JVM to warm up, 
but we also instrumented all third party classes, as well as recorded all method calls. 
There are benchmarks which measure the overhead of instrumenting and recording apps. 
The data shows that for a typical enterprise app, the overhead is around x3-x5 with proper warm 
up comparing to not using the agent at all.

Another thing you probably noticed, is that the name of the class is `PersonStoreService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$739c2d5f` 
rather that just `PersonStoreService`. That’s simply because the class is marked with `@Transactional` annotation. 
Spring will create a proxy for managing transactions, and then recording starts upon the proxy call.

Let’s dive deep into `save` method recorded calls. The recording data is presented in form of a tree with collapsible nodes. 
Every node is a recorded method call. Nodes are also marked with black pane which hints how many nested calls a 
node has comparing to the other nodes. The first thing we can see is that Spring proxy actually 
calls the instance of `TransactionInterceptor`:

![TransactionInterceptor](https://cheburitos.github.io/assets/2024/10-13/hibernate2.png)

If we dive deeper, we can see that our `PersonStoreService` is called after the transaction is started. 
Our transaction manager is an instance of `JpaTransactionManager` class. We can also see a call to 
`TransactionInterceptor.commitTransactionAfterReturning` where the opened transaction is supposedly commited.

![hibernate](https://cheburitos.github.io/assets/2024/10-13/hibernate3.png)

The further exploration points where the instance of `EntityManager` is called:

![entity manager](https://cheburitos.github.io/assets/2024/10-13/hibernate4.png)

At this point we see only simple class names (i.e. no package name), and it might be hard to tell which 
classes belong to Hibernate. That’s exactly why Ulyp can show full class names. 
Just select a node and hold the Shift button, and it you will see fully qualified names:

![show types feature](https://cheburitos.github.io/assets/2024/10-13/hibernate5.png)

If we wanted we could dive deep down to H2 database level where JDBC statement is created and executed (this happens when the transaction is commited).

### Conclusion

This was a simple demo of using Ulyp. Other cases include (but not limited to):

* tracing distributed systems running in clouds
* gathering gigs of data for later analysis
* recording realtime apps where stopping a thread using a conventional debugger is not an option
* finding inefficiencies in a gigantic frameworks

Ulyp doesn’t try to solve all the existing problems and it’s definitely not a silver bullet. 
The overhead of instrumenting could be quite high. You might now want to run it on production environment, 
but dev/test are usually ok. But if one can run their software app locally or on dev environment, 
it opens the opportunity to see things at completely different angle.
